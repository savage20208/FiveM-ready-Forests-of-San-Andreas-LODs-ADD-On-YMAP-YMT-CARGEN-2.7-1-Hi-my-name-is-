Here select which ever you want and Create a whole new folder called Silo-hatch then inside that create a stream folder and a __resource.lua 
*just copy the __resource.lua from one of the other maps* inside the stream folder put the .ymap file of whichever map you chose and then start 
the "Silo-Hatch" in your server.cfg  

enjoy the map
