Create a new folder in this folder called stream then drag the .ymap file and place it in there after that 
copy one of the __resource.lua that has been provided with the other maps and place it in the same directory 
where you made the stream folder 
make sure to start the file name "Abandoned red car" in your server.cfg 

enjoy the map
